# Madolescent
The purpose of creating this project was to create a more advanced website than we 
already had for our clothing brand Madolescent. We chose this project because we 
wanted to create an online clothing store thats different than all of the other ones.

We designed the project uing HTML CSS and JavaScript. The biggest challenges were honestly
starting the basics for the project. The beggining framework and linking the whole project 
together took the most effort and it was smooth sailing from there.
